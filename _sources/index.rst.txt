About Me
=========

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland at College Park where
I am a computer science major on the machine learning track, as well as a statistics minor.
My current experiences are related to my interest in research including a paper on nematode classification
using deep learning methods
and a research experience involving the creation of a new neural video codec which promises
a balance of quality, speed, and compression.
