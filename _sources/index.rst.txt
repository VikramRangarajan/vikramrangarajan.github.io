Experience & Projects
=====================

.. card:: Shahoveisi Lab - 02/24 to Present
	:link: https://sites.google.com/view/umdturfgrasspathology/home

	Undergraduate Research Assistant

	Assisted in creating manuscripts for machine learning research projects related to identifying and managing turfgrass related diseases

	Used methods such as transfer learning and gradual unfreezing to train highly accurate nematode image classifiers

	Performed automatic hyperparameter optimization to train scikit-learn and PyTorch models to achieve highest metrics

	Performed image dataset preprocessing for use in a PyTorch deep neural network image classifier using OpenCV

.. card:: SimpleTensor - 02/24 to Present
	:link: https://vikramrangarajan.github.io/SimpleTensor/

	

	Created a library which provides Tensors with reverse-mode automatic differentiation capabilities using only numpy arrays for the Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CMSC421) class

	Supports many differentiable n-dimensional tensor operations such as matrix multiplication, convolution, element-wise functions, aggregate functions, and arithmetic operations, with support for operations along any axes

	Created MNIST demo using convolutional, dense, and normalization layers and used techniques such as Xavier/Glorot initialization and residual connections

	Fully documented using sphinx at https://vikramrangarajan.github.io/SimpleTensor/

.. card:: SimplePyML - 08/23 to Present
	:link: https://vikramrangarajan.github.io/simplepyml/

	

	Created Python library to implement and understand machine learning algorithms using numpy and scipy

	Implemented dynamic multilayer perceptron networks with more features to come

	Achieved ~98.6% accuracy with MNIST database after some testing, but not enough testing has been done to find maximum accuracy

	Successfully implemented conditional GPU acceleration using cupy

	Fully documented using sphinx at https://vikramrangarajan.github.io/simplepyml

.. card:: A.M. Best Rating Services - 10/23 to 01/24

	Data Strategy Engineer

	Responsible for transitioning workflows from Prefect to Apache Airflow

	Learned to use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to transform data on the Azure Cloud Platform

	Used Airflow to orchestrate pipelines on ADF and prepared Airflow features for production use such as notifications, encryption, error handling, and failsafes

	Accelerated a data pipeline from 90 minutes down to 6 minutes

.. card:: A.M. Best Rating Services - 06/23 to 07/24

	Data Strategy & Architecture Intern

	Learned to use and manage virtual machines such as Docker containers with services and WSL

	Discovered Apache Airflow’s workflow management features and architecture, and presented knowledge to 7 teammates

	Set up and connected to a PostgreSQL database through Airflow to insert live government weather data hourly for over 900 cities nationwide

	Created an ETL pipeline in 2 weeks which automatically extracted data from oracle databases and loaded them to an Azure Data Lake with Pandas as the link

	Followed the software development life cycle to create ETLs and progress them all the way through the testing environment
