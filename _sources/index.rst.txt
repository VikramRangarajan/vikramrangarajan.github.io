About Me
=========

I am a Computer Science PhD student at Purdue University advised by Professor Rajiv Khanna with a focus on AI/ML and optimization problems.

I was an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland at College Park (graduated May 2025) where
I majored in computer science on the machine learning track with a minor in statistics.
My recent experiences are related to my research including a paper on plant-parasitic nematode classification
using deep learning methods
and a `project <https://vikramrangarajan.github.io/SIEDD/>`_ involving the creation of a new neural video codec which promises
a balance of quality, speed, and compression.
